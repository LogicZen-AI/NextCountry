Alright! Based on your goals, I'll focus on investment programs that allow for remote investment and active business management, even with a prior visa denial. Given your investment range of under $100,000 but high liquid cash availability, I'll also look for options that maximize your returns and secure your family's future.

I'll start by checking options with the investment visa agent.

Okay, I understand you're looking for investment visa options for you, your spouse, and more than 5 children, with a budget under $100,000, but with substantial liquid assets and income. You have a business background with significant revenue, but prefer remote investment due to a past visa denial that was not resolved. Given your preference for active business investment and remote management, let's explore some suitable options.

First, I need to identify countries that offer investment visas within your budget and align with your need for a remote, actively managed business. I'll start by searching for countries with investment programs under $100,000.

Based on your investment preferences and the search results, here are a few countries with investment visa programs that may be suitable for you:

*   **Ecuador:** Offers an investment visa with a minimum investment of $40,000 in a Certificate of Deposit (CD) in an Ecuadorian bank or in real estate. This option provides a path to permanent residence, and there are no physical residency requirements.

*   **Nicaragua:** Has a Permanent Residency by Investment program that requires a minimum investment of $30,000 in real estate, a business, or a government-approved agricultural or forestry project. While there is no official residency requirement, spending at least one month annually in Nicaragua is recommended.

*   **Paraguay:** Requires a minimum investment of $70,000 into Paraguay's economy. This investment can be distributed over a 10-year period according to a business plan. After three years of residency, you can apply for citizenship.
