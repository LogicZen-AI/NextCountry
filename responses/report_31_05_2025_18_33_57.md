Okay, I understand you're an Albanian national looking for digital nomad visa options in Europe, specifically Portugal, Spain, or Estonia, with your spouse and 1-2 dependents. Your monthly income is less than $1,500, but you have savings of $50,000+. You're not prioritizing tax benefits and plan to return home after the visa expires. You also need help finding accommodation. Given your previous visa denial, we'll need to be extra careful.

I'll focus on finding suitable digital nomad visas in Europe, excluding Albania. I will also consider your income and savings to assess your eligibility for each visa. I will pay special attention to countries that are more lenient with income requirements or consider savings as proof of sufficient funds.

Given your circumstances, here's a breakdown of potential options and considerations for your digital nomad journey:

**Eligible Countries & Recommendations**

Considering your preference for Europe and your income level, here are a few countries that might be suitable, along with some insights:

*   **Estonia:** Estonia offers a Digital Nomad Visa, but given your past visa denial, it's crucial to address the reasons for that denial transparently in your application.
*   **Spain:** Spain has a Digital Nomad Visa.
*   **Portugal:** Portugal is a popular choice, but the cost of living in major cities has increased. Consider smaller towns or rural areas.

**Visa Information**

Let's start by checking the vector database for visa information and requirements.

Based on your criteria, here's a breakdown of your options:

**Estonia:**

*   **Visa Type:** Estonia offers a Digital Nomad Visa (DNV).
*   **Requirements:** I will need to conduct a search to provide the requirements for the Estonia Digital Nomad Visa.

**Spain:**

*   **Visa Type:** Spain offers a Digital Nomad Visa.
*   **Requirements:** I will need to conduct a search to provide the requirements for the Spain Digital Nomad Visa.

**Portugal:**

*   **Visa Type:** Portugal offers a Digital Nomad Visa.
*   **Requirements:** I will need to conduct a search to provide the requirements for the Portugal Digital Nomad Visa.

Since you have a prior visa denial that was not resolved, it's important to consider this may impact your chances of approval for any new visa applications. Disclosing this information transparently and providing documentation related to the denial will be crucial.

I will now search for the requirements for each of the visas mentioned above.

Based on your requirements, here's a breakdown of potential options:

**Estonia:**

*   **Visa Type:** Digital Nomad Visa (D-visa or C-visa converted)
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Valid passport (3 months beyond visa term)
    *   Work remotely as employee, freelancer, or business owner for company/clients outside Estonia.
    *   Documents proving eligibility as location-independent worker.

**Spain:**

*   **Visa Type:** Digital Nomad Visa
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Non-EU/EEA citizen
    *   Work remotely for foreign employers/clients.
    *   Have a contract with a non-Spanish company trading for at least a year, with at least 3 months of employment.
    *   Income of at least twice the Spanish minimum wage (approximately ‚Ç¨33,144 gross annually for 2025).
    *   Must stay in the country for at least 183 days per year

**Portugal:**

*   **Visa Type:** D8 Visa (officially) or D9 (by some consulates)
    *   Temporary Stay: 12 months
    *   Long Stay (Residence Visa): 24 months, renewable for 36 months.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Freelancer/remote worker with monthly income of at least ‚Ç¨3,480.

Given your income is less than $1,500 per month, Spain might not be a viable option at this time. Portugal and Estonia seem more attainable.

Since you need help finding accommodation, I can search for resources in either Estonia or Portugal.

Based on your requirements, here's a breakdown of potential options for you and your spouse as digital nomads:

**Visa Options:**

*   **Estonia Digital Nomad Visa:** Estonia offers a Digital Nomad Visa (D-visa) that allows you to stay in Estonia while working remotely for a company or clients established outside of Estonia. You'll need to provide documents proving you meet the eligibility requirements of being a location-independent employee or digital nomad.

*   **Spain Digital Nomad Visa:** Spain's Digital Nomad Visa is designed for non-EU/EEA citizens who want to live in Spain while working remotely for employers or clients outside of Spain. To qualify, you'll generally need to show proof of a salary or income that meets at least twice the Spanish minimum wage (approximately ‚Ç¨33,144 gross income annually for the primary applicant in 2025).

*   **Portugal Digital Nomad Visa:** Portugal has a Digital Nomad Visa (D8) for freelancers and remote workers with a monthly income of at least ‚Ç¨3,480. There are two options: a temporary stay visa (12 months) and a long-term residency visa (24 months, renewable for 36 months).

**Considerations based on your situation:**

*   **Income:** With a monthly income of less than $1,500, the Spanish and Portuguese Digital Nomad Visas might be challenging to obtain initially, as they have minimum income requirements. Estonia might be a more accessible starting point.
*   **Previous Visa Denial:** Since you have a previous unresolved visa denial, it's important to gather all documentation related to that denial and be prepared to address it transparently in any new visa application. This could impact the processing and outcome of your application.
*   **Dependents:** All the digital nomad visas you are eligible for, allow you to bring your dependents.
*   **Accommodation:**

    *   **Estonia:** You can find studio flats in Tallinn for around $650 USD/month.
    *   **Portugal:** Rent for a one-bedroom apartment in the city center averages around ‚Ç¨1,000.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Estonia:** Given your income level and the desire to explore options, Estonia's Digital Nomad Visa seems like the most immediately accessible option.

2.  **Accommodation Search:**

    *   **Estonia:** Check out City24.ee and Kv.ee for rental contracts. Also, the "Digital nomad Estonia" Facebook group can be a good resource.
    *   **Portugal:** Decide whether you need a villa, a one-room apartment, or a two-room apartment, or an Airbnb before searching for a property in Portugal.

I hope this information is helpful.
