Okay, I've got all the details! Considering your interest in European Union real estate investment, your desire to run your business in the new country, and your investment amount, I'm going to hand this over to our investment visa expert. They'll be able to lay out the best options for you!Based on your profile, here's a breakdown of potential investment options within the European Union, focusing on real estate and considering your interest in running a business:

**Country Recommendation: Portugal**

*   **Why Portugal?** Portugal offers a favorable "Golden Visa" program, a growing real estate market, and a relatively straightforward path to residency. It's also considered safe and stable, aligning with your goal of securing your family's future.

*   **Suitable Locations:** Lisbon (for business opportunities and rental income), Porto (more affordable than Lisbon, with a strong tourism sector), Algarve (popular for tourism and retirement, offering good rental potential).

*   **Investment Options:** Given your preference for real estate and running a business, consider purchasing commercial properties (shops, offices) in Lisbon or Porto and establishing your business there. Alternatively, explore residential properties in tourist areas like the Algarve for rental income and potential future appreciation.

**Visa Category: Portugal Golden Visa**

*   **Investment Options that Qualify:** Purchasing real estate (€500,000 or €350,000 in designated low-density areas).

**Requirements for Portugal Golden Visa:**Based on your profile, here's a breakdown of potential investment options in the EU, focusing on Portugal, Spain, and Greece:

**Country Considerations:**

*   **Portugal:** The Golden Visa program was a popular option, but it has undergone changes. Real estate options are now limited to specific areas and uses. However, investment funds are still an eligible route. Given your investment amount and desire for an active business, this could be a viable option.
*   **Spain:** Offers a Golden Visa through real estate investment (€500,000 minimum). With your budget, you could acquire property and potentially establish your business.
*   **Greece:** Similar to Spain, Greece offers a Golden Visa via real estate investment (€250,000 - €500,000 depending on the region). It's a potentially more affordable entry point, leaving more capital for your business.

**Suitable Locations to Invest:**

*   **Portugal:**
    *   **Lisbon/Porto (for specific purposes only):** High-demand rental markets, but Golden Visa real estate options are restricted.
    *   **Interior regions or Azores/Madeira Islands:** May offer qualifying real estate options under the Golden Visa.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Criminal Record:** Your criminal record will be a significant factor. Each country will assess the nature and severity of the offense. Seek legal counsel to understand how this might impact your application.
*   **Financing:** While you prefer not to use financing, be aware that some programs may have restrictions on using loans for the investment.
*   **Tax Optimization:** Consult with a tax advisor specializing in international investment to understand the tax implications of your investment and residency in each country.
*   **Relocation:** Even if you prefer remote investment, some programs may require a minimum stay in the country to maintain residency.
