Okay, I understand you're an Algerian citizen looking to visit American Samoa for tourism purposes, planning to stay for over 90 days, and you've unfortunately had past unresolved visa issues. Given your circumstances, let's explore some potential options for you. I'll start by getting some advice from our Tourist Visa Agent.

Okay, I will help you with your trip to American Samoa. First, let's explore American Samoa to see what it has to offer.

American Samoa is a great destination offering affordable accommodations, diverse retail options, and eco-tourism. Key attractions include the National Park of American Samoa, beautiful beaches, and historical sites.

I was unable to find specific information about tourist visa requirements for American Samoa in the vector database. However, American Samoa is a territory of the United States, so the entry requirements are generally the same as for the United States.

American Samoa does not have a visa waiver program for Algerian citizens. As an Algerian citizen, you are required to apply for an entry visa to visit American Samoa for tourism purposes. Since you plan to stay for more than 90 days, you will need a 30 Day Permit, which can be extended.

Here are the requirements for the 30 Day Permit:

1.  Copy of valid passport or Document of Identity (both must be valid for at least six (6) months prior to date of departure from American Samoa).
2.  Copy of itinerary or ticket (must be a round trip ticket).
3.  Clearance from the District Court of American Samoa.
4.  Clearance from the Lyndon B. Johnson Tropical Medical Center (LBJ) business office.
5.  Police clearance from traveler's home country.
6.  Medical/health clearance from traveler's home country.
7.  30 Day Permit must be requested at least 3 business days prior to date of travel to American Samoa.
8.  Local sponsor must obtain signatures from sponsor's family sa'o as well as the pulenu'u of the sponsor's village or residence. If the local sponsor holds a deed for privately owned land, signature of the sa'o will not be required. Must provide a copy of the deed with local sponsor's name.
9.  Local sponsor must show up at the Immigration Office to ensure all the required documents are included in the application package, to sign the application and to verify their identity BEFORE 30 Day Permit application is processed.

The fee for a 30 Day Permit is $40 USD (non-refundable). The extension fee is $50 USD.

Given your circumstances, including a prior unresolved visa denial and limited ties to your home country, it is advisable to gather all required documents meticulously and provide a detailed explanation for the purpose of your visit to increase your chances of a successful visa application.
