Okay, I understand you're looking to expand your existing services/consulting/agency business (250+ employees, $100k-$500k revenue) into a new country, ideally in the EU but open to suggestions. Your budget is $50k-$200k, and you're planning to relocate yourself and your spouse, along with key management. You have a flexible timeline of 6-12 months. Given your parameters, I'll transfer you to our Expand Existing Business Visa Agent to explore the best options. After that, I will refine the results.
