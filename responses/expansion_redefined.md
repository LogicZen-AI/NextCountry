Okay, I will help you explore options to expand your existing business. Given your parameters, I'll focus on countries and visa options that suit businesses with multiple partners, a substantial number of employees, and a revenue range of $100,000–$500,000, with a budget of $50k–$200k for expansion. I will start by routing you to the 'expand\_existing\_business\_visa\_agent'.

Okay, I understand you're looking to expand your services/consulting/agency business, which has a revenue between $100,000–$500,000, into a new country with a budget of $50k–$200k and a timeline of 3–6 months. You have 250+ employees and are open to suggestions for location, though you mentioned American Samoa. You're planning to relocate the founder and key management team (including you and your spouse), and you're still exploring long-term goals. You don't speak English and haven't expanded abroad before. You're also open to living 180 days a year in the new country.

Given your parameters, let's explore some suitable options for business expansion and investor visas, focusing on locations that align with your budget, industry, and language needs.

First, let's investigate American Samoa.

American Samoa's economy is heavily reliant on the tuna processing industry, support for tuna boat fleets, and government transfers. Pago Pago Harbor is a deep-water port that has fostered industrial activity for over 50 years. The territory is actively seeking foreign direct investment to diversify the economy and create jobs. Opportunities exist in fishing, tourism, and government support.

American Samoa is a promising location for expanding your business, especially given your interest and the territory's openness to foreign investment. The economy is largely based on tuna processing, support for tuna boat fleets, and government transfers. Pago Pago Harbor offers an excellent deep-water port.

Given your budget of $50k–$200k, the E-2 Treaty Investor Visa for the United States could be a viable option. However, since American Samoa is a territory of the United States, the applicability of the E-2 visa may differ compared to applying within the mainland U.S.

**E-2 Visa Requirements:**
*   **Citizenship:** You must be a citizen of a country with which the U.S. maintains a treaty of commerce and navigation.
*   **Real and Active Business:** The business must be real, operational, or close to operational.
*   **Economic Contribution:** The enterprise must contribute to the U.S. economy and create jobs for U.S. citizens.
*   **Not Marginal:** The business cannot exist solely to provide a living for the investor and family.
*   **Substantial Investment:** The investment must be "substantial" relative to the business cost. While there's no fixed minimum, investments below $100,000 are rarely approved.
*   **Legal and Controlled Funds:** Funds must be obtained through legal means and be fully under investor control.
*   **At-Risk Investment:** The investment must be "at risk" in a commercial sense and irrevocably committed to the venture.
*   **No Loans or Inheritance:** Cannot be funded through inheritance or loans.

Given that you don't speak English, it's crucial to factor in translation services and potentially bilingual staff to facilitate business operations and communication with local authorities.

Considering your situation, I recommend consulting with an immigration attorney who specializes in U.S. visas and has specific experience with American Samoa to confirm the E-2 visa's applicability and navigate any unique requirements.
