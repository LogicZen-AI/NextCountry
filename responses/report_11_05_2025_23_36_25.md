**Visa Options for Expanding Your Fintech Business in the UK:**

Given your situation, the Global Business Mobility visa, specifically the UK Expansion Worker visa, seems like a suitable option. This visa is designed for senior managers or specialist employees of an overseas business that needs to establish a UK branch or subsidiary.

**Key Requirements and Considerations:**

*   **Sponsor:** Your company will need to have a UK branch or subsidiary to sponsor you.
*   **Overseas Work:** You should have worked for the overseas business for at least 12 months unless you are a high earner.
*   **Salary:** The salary threshold is £45,800 per year or the going rate for the role, whichever is higher.
*   **Financial Maintenance:** You'll need to show £1,270 in your account for 28 days unless your sponsor certifies that they will cover your maintenance.
*   **Dependents:** Your dependents (4) can apply, but you'll need to show additional funds to support them.
*   **Maximum Stay:** The visa is initially valid for 2 years, but you can switch to other eligible routes for long-term settlement.

**Steps to Take:**

1.  **Establish a UK Branch/Subsidiary:** Set up a UK branch or subsidiary of your Fintech company.
2.  **Sponsor Licence:** Your UK entity needs to obtain a provisional sponsor license for the Expansion Worker route.
3.  **Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS):** Obtain a valid CoS for a role at RQF Level 6 or higher, confirming it's a genuine vacancy.
