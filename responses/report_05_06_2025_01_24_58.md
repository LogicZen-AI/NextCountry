Okay, I understand you're an Albanian national aiming to explore digital nomad opportunities in Europe with your spouse, despite a past visa denial and a criminal record. Given your circumstances, I'll focus on countries with potentially more lenient requirements or specific programs tailored to unique situations.

I'm transferring you to the Nomad Visa Agent to explore options, but I'll carefully review and enhance their suggestions to ensure they're realistic and helpful.

I understand you're looking for digital nomad opportunities in Europe, specifically Switzerland, Norway, and Iceland, despite a past visa denial and a criminal record. Given your monthly income is less than $1,500, but you have significant savings, and you're traveling with your spouse and potentially one other dependent, here's a breakdown of potential options and important considerations:

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Visa Denials & Criminal Record:** These factors significantly complicate visa applications. You'll need to be upfront and transparent with any immigration authorities. Provide detailed explanations and any supporting documentation related to both the past denial and the criminal record. Some countries may have stricter policies than others.
*   **Income Requirement:** Your current income is a challenge for many digital nomad visas, which often have minimum income thresholds. Your savings might help offset this, but it's crucial to research specific requirements.

**Country Options & Visa Information:**

Given your preferences and circumstances, let's examine some options:

1.  **Iceland:**

    *   **Digital Nomad Visa:** Iceland offers a long-term visa for remote workers. However, it generally requires a significantly higher monthly income than you currently have.
    *   **Requirements:** While specific requirements can change, expect a minimum monthly income requirement (often around $7,400 USD), proof of health insurance, and a clean criminal record. Given your circumstances, Iceland might be difficult.

Based on the search results, here's what I found regarding your situation and the possibility of obtaining a digital nomad visa, particularly focusing on Iceland, given your region of interest:

**Iceland Digital Nomad Visa and Criminal Record:**

*   **Clean Criminal Record:** Most sources indicate that a clean criminal record is generally required for a digital nomad visa. The Iceland Digital Nomad Visa is no exception.
*   **Requirement:** The directorate of Immigration may request a clean criminal record certificate.

**General Considerations for Digital Nomad Visas and Criminal Records:**

*   **Impact of Criminal Record:** Having a criminal record, especially one that was not resolved, can significantly impact your eligibility for a digital nomad visa. Each country has its own criteria, and some may be more lenient than others depending on the nature and severity of the crime.
*   **Full Disclosure:** It is crucial to be honest and transparent about your criminal record in your application. Withholding information can lead to automatic denial and potential future immigration issues.
*   **Additional Documents:** Be prepared to provide additional documentation related to your criminal record, such as court records or rehabilitation certificates, if required.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Targeted Research:** Given your criminal record, research the specific policies of countries you are interested in. Some countries may have provisions for considering applicants with minor offenses or those that occurred a long time ago.
2.  **Legal Advice:** Consult with an immigration lawyer who specializes in digital nomad visas. They can assess your situation, advise you on the best course of action, and help you prepare a strong application.
3.  **Alternative Options:** If obtaining a digital nomad visa proves challenging, consider exploring other options, such as:

    *   **Countries with More Lenient Policies:** Research countries with more lenient policies regarding criminal records and visa applications.
    *   **Shorter Stays:** Consider traveling to countries that allow visa-free entry for your nationality for a limited period. While this won't provide long-term residency, it can allow you to experience the digital nomad lifestyle temporarily.

**Disclaimer:**

*   Visa requirements and policies can change, so it's essential to verify the most up-to-date information from official government sources or immigration authorities.
*   This information is not legal advice, and you should consult with a qualified professional for personalized guidance.
