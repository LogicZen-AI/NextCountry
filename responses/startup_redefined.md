Okay, I understand you're looking for investment visa options in North America and Canada to secure a safe future for your family and build a real estate portfolio, but you prefer to invest remotely. Given your financial situation and desire for active business involvement, let's explore some suitable pathways. I'll start by consulting the investment visa agent and then enrich the response with more options and insights.

Okay, I understand you're looking for investment programs in North America and Canada to secure a safe future for your family and build a real estate portfolio. You're willing to invest less than $100,000, prefer an active business investment, and want to include your spouse and one child in the application. You're currently unemployed but have a strong business background with significant annual revenue from your previous company and a high monthly income. You don't need immediate residency or citizenship and prefer remote investment.

Given your investment budget of less than $100,000 and preference for active business investment, let's explore potential options in North America and Canada. I will start by identifying suitable countries and then delve into specific investment opportunities and visa requirements.

First, I will use the `search_exa` tool to identify eligible countries.

Based on your interest in North America and Canada with an investment budget under $100,000, here are a few options to consider:

**1. United States E-2 Investor Visa:**
*   **Investment:** While the U.S. government doesn't specify a minimum investment amount for the E-2 Visa, an average investment of $100,000 to $200,000 is generally expected. Some service industries may be approved with investments less than $100,000, but it is risky.
*   **Business Type:** You must invest in a real, active business, not in real estate or stocks.
*   **Active Involvement:** This visa requires you to actively direct and develop the business.
*   **Citizenship Requirement:** The E-2 visa is available to citizens of countries that have a treaty of commerce and navigation with the United States.
*   **Visa Requirements:**

Based on your preferences and investment range, here are potential options for investment programs:

**1. United States - E-2 Treaty Investor Visa:**

*   **Investment:** While the official minimum is not set, investments around $100,000 are more likely to be approved.
*   **Business Type:** You need to invest in a real, operating business that benefits the U.S. economy and creates jobs. The business should not be marginal, meaning it should do more than provide a basic living for you and your family.
*   **Active Involvement:** This visa requires you to actively direct and develop the business.
*   **Visa Requirements:**
    *   Be a citizen of a treaty country with the U.S. (check if Pakistan is on the list).
    *   Have a substantial investment at risk.
    *   Intend to depart the U.S. when the visa terminates.
*   **Additional Information:**
    *   The E-2 visa does not directly lead to a Green Card, but you can apply for one separately if you meet the requirements.
    *   Your spouse can apply for work authorization, and children under 21 can attend school.

**2. Canada - Start-Up Visa Program**

*   **Investment:** No minimum investment is required if your business is accepted into a designated incubator program. If pursuing the angel investment or venture capital route, the minimum investment is CAD 75,000 or CAD 200,000, respectively.
*   **Business Type**: Your business must be innovative, create jobs for Canadians, and have the potential to compete globally.
*   **Active Involvement**: You must actively manage the business from within Canada.
*   **Visa Requirements**:
    *   Have a qualifying business.
    *   Get a letter of support from a designated organization.
    *   Meet minimum language requirements (CLB 5 in English or French).
    *   Have sufficient settlement funds.
*   **Additional Information**:
    *   This program leads to permanent residency.
    *   You need to secure support from a designated venture capital fund, angel investor group, or business incubator.

**Recommendation:**

Given your interest in North America, active business involvement, and investment capacity, both the U.S. E-2 Visa and the Canada Start-Up Visa are viable options.

*   If you prefer remote investment and are comfortable with the need to leave the country when the visa expires, the **E-2 Visa** might be suitable. However, it does not guarantee permanent residency.
*   If you are willing to relocate and actively manage a business in Canada, the **Start-Up Visa** offers a path to permanent residency and aligns with your long-term goal of building a real estate portfolio, as permanent residents have more opportunities for property investment.

Before making a decision, it is essential to verify whether Pakistan has a trade treaty with the U.S. for the E-2 visa.
