Okay, I understand you're an Albanian national with extensive experience as a Machine Learning Engineer seeking a work and residence visa, ideally sponsored, for yourself and a large family (5+ dependents). Given your past visa denial and preference for employer sponsorship, finding the right opportunity will be key. I'm going to have our Employment Visa Agent take a look, but I'll be sure to enhance their suggestions with alternatives and crucial details.

Okay, I understand you're looking for countries that offer employment opportunities and are willing to sponsor visas, considering your large family and need for financial assistance. Given your background as a Machine Learning Engineer with over 10 years of experience and a high salary expectation, let's explore some options.

First, I will identify countries with potential opportunities using `search_exa`. Then, I'll use `search_tavily` to gather detailed insights about each country, focusing on areas with a high demand for Machine Learning Engineers. After that, I'll try to determine the most appropriate visa category using `vecdb_tool` or `search_exa` if necessary, and list all visa requirements, primarily using `vecdb_tool`.

I will start by searching for countries known for tech jobs and potential visa sponsorships.

Based on your requirements and the search results, here are a few countries that might be suitable for you:

**1. Canada:**

*   **Why:** Canada has a high demand for tech workers and offers the Global Talent Stream visa, which can expedite the process for skilled workers.
*   **Considerations:** While the employer typically handles much of the visa application, they need to demonstrate a need for a foreign worker.

**2. Germany:**

*   **Why:** Germany is a major innovation hub with a strong tech industry. They offer a work visa for IT experts with at least three years of experience.
*   **Considerations:** You'll need an IT job offer and may need to demonstrate German language proficiency (though this can be waived if the job doesn't require it). The minimum gross annual salary requirement is also a factor.

**3. United Kingdom:**

*   **Why:** The Global Talent Visa scheme is available for leaders or potential leaders in digital technology. A job offer is not required for this visa.
*   **Considerations:** You'll need to be endorsed as a tech expert with "exceptional promise" or "exceptional talent."

Since you need an employer to cover all costs and you have a prior visa denial, the best approach would be to focus on countries where the employer plays a significant role in the visa application and is willing to sponsor you.

Let's start by gathering more information on the requirements for the Canadian Global Talent Stream visa.

Based on your responses, here's a breakdown of potential countries and visa options, keeping in mind your specific needs:

**Suitable Countries & Why:**

*   **Germany:** Offers a work visa for IT experts with 3+ years of experience. A job offer is mandatory, and you need to meet the salary threshold.
*   **UK:** The Global Talent Visa is an option if you're recognized as a leader or potential leader in digital technology. It doesn't require a job offer.
*   **Singapore:** The Tech.Pass visa is for established tech experts. It has specific requirements related to salary, experience, or company valuation.

**Visa Options & Requirements:**

Since you need employer sponsorship and financial assistance, your options are limited. Here's a closer look at the visas that might align with your situation:

1.  **CANADA - Global Talent Stream:**

        *   You may need to demonstrate English or French language proficiency.
        *   You'll need to prove you have the skills and experience for the job.

    *   **Considerations:** This visa is highly competitive.

**Actionable Steps:**

1.  **Targeted Job Search:** Focus your job search on companies in Canada and Germany that are known to sponsor visas. Tailor your resume and cover letter to highlight your machine learning expertise and experience.
2.  **UK Global Talent Visa Assessment:** Review the Tech Nation guidelines for endorsement and assess whether your profile aligns with their criteria.
3.  **Financial Assistance:** Since you need an employer to cover costs, prioritize companies that offer relocation packages and visa sponsorship. Be upfront about your financial needs during the job application process.
